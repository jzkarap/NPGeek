NPGeek is a CSS rich website that displays a list of parks and park images from a database, querying for data using SQL. It features a list of parks, a detail page for each park, and a survey page where users can submit a vote for their favorite park. It retains these votes within the parks database to display a results page with a full history of votes.

To add:
- Tie into email verification API so survey accepts only existing emails
- Allow an email to submit only one survey (so votes can't be spammed)
	> Consider allowing one submission per email per day or per week
